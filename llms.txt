# Pomodoro Timer

> A Pomodoro timer application built with Rust and egui framework.
> This project implements the Pomodoro Technique for time management,
> allowing users to work in focused intervals with breaks.
> No sound notifications - only visual feedback through window flashing.

This is a desktop application that provides a Pomodoro timer functionality:

- 25-minute work sessions (pomodoros)
- 5-minute short breaks between sessions
- Visual notifications only (no sound) - window flashing at timer completion
- Configurable flash colors (white/black/red/blue/green)
- Full-screen button interface
- Settings persistence to `~/.config/pomodoro/settings.ini`
- Clean, modern GUI built with egui
